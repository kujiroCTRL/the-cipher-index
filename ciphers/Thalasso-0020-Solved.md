Each segment is filled with a color whose hexadecimal values read

```
00 46 41
4c 41 44
4f 4d 49
53 49 4c
41 53 4f
4c 53 49
4c 41 53
49 4d 49
```

Ignoring the leading '00' (which was actually a misformat of the code) the hexadecimal values can be translated to


```
00 F  A
L  A  D
O  M  I
S  I  L
A  S  O
L  S  I
L  A  S
I  M  I
```

This can be read as 'FA LA DO MI SI LA SOL SI LA SI MI' which are musical notes written in the Romance note system 

Converting to the English note convention the text reads 'AFACEBAGBABE' or 'A FACE BAG BABE'

In Cipher Academy a group of students are presented always wearing face bags covering their faces and in the 'Capture trilemma arc' the 'face bag babe' class played the role of the snake team

Thus the culprit is a snake as originally hinted by the silhouette presented in the image
