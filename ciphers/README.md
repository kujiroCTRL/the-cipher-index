I am currently writing the solution to code 27

Some ciphers like 23 have been solved but I still have not figured out the complete answer

Until I do, I won't write their solution

There are plenty more ciphers on the Discord server I've not even made a file for 

Last time I counted the CA's Discord server's cipher count was of 76 ciphers (torture sessions and project proposals and private codes exluded)
