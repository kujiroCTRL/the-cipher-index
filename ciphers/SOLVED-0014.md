The four circles are filled with four distinct colors which read in hex give

- 21217D for the circle to the left
- 4343AE for the upper one 
- 4F4F9A for the bottom one
- 4343AE for the one to the right

The last digits read 'DEAF' which is the answer to the original question (is not for 'Blind' but for 'Deaf')
