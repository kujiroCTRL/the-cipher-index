**Prompt**
> My favorite meaning of “colour” is “a shade of meaning”. In cipher academy there are no colour related ciphers because readers wouldn’t be able to enjoy them, but here I present you with one. A friend of mine sent me this. Actually, it’s a code made by his little daughter to reveal her favorite colour, so don't think too hard about it.
