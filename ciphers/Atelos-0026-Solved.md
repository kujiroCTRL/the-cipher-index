**Prompt**
> My favorite meaning of “colour” is “a shade of meaning”. In cipher academy there are no colour related ciphers because readers wouldn’t be able to enjoy them, but here I present you with one. A friend of mine sent me this. Actually, it’s a code made by his little daughter to reveal her favorite colour, so don't think too hard about it.

<summary>Solution</summary>
Each line connects a part of the monster's body to a bar

Filling each bar with the color, or the combination of colors of the monster we read respectively on the top, left and right bars the words

```
ORANGE
PURPLE
YELLOW
```

Under some letters there are numbers from 1 to 6 and writing the corresponding letters with the given order yields the word `WEAPON`

Since the cipher was made by a child and the colour is a shade of meaning, we can interpret the word "WEAPON" as the monster's horns which are green

Thus the child's favorite color is green
