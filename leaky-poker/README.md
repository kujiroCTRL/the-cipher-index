## "Leaky poker" CA's Discord server edition

In this folder we will periodically upload the designs and source files for the CA's Discord server's "Leaky poker" proposed by code specialist "Illyngo"

The folder also contains images for the original leaky poker, under the `original/` subdirectory

Like in the original leaky poker, each member chose a number and designed the four cards (heart, spade, diamond and club suits) corresponding to that number  

The following table contains the participants' names as well as the number they chose

|Number	|Name		|
|---	|---		|
|Ace	|		|
|2	|Reine		|
|3	|Reine		|
|4	|veggie		|
