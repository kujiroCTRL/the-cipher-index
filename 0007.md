> In morse code the 3 sets of symbols read 'COO' hinting towards 'CO2' or carbon dioxide
> On closer inspection the first and last letters are joined by 3 lines which in chemistry indicates a triple bond
> Overall regarding the symbol in the middle as a chemical bond, the diagram would represent a carbon atom bonded with an oxigen atom
> In IUPAC CO corresponds to carbon monoxide, which is the answer to the code
